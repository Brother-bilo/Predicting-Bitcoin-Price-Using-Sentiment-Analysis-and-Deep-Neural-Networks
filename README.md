# Predictive Ability of Sentiment and Various Features on Cryptocurrency Prices
This repository includes all resources regarding my research, "Predictive Ability of Sentiment and Various Features on Cryptocurrency Prices" (working title). This paper reviews the ability to predict Bitcoin price using sentiment analysis of tweets and other features such as block size, cost per TX, hash rate, etc.

This was research I did for my Econometrics project during the Spring 2022 semester. I am currently in the process of making the python sentiment bot and shortly after will apply econometric methods to the data in R. 

I plan on taking a deep dive into error analysis over the summer to improve text classification that will likely increase predictive power of the sentiment bot. Hopefully I can produce some sort of indicator traders can use on charting sites such as TradingView, and DEXTools. Also plan on cleaning up the code as I get better at python over the summer.

Update 5/3/2022: The sentiment part will have to wait as my AWS server collects data daily, because my academic permissions for doing a full search with the Twitter API got denied. This server will collect data for about 3-6 months in order for my estimators to be as efficient as possible.
