# Predicting Bitcoin Volatility with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks: A Comparative Study of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches
This repository includes all resources regarding my partner and I's research, "Predicting Bitcoin Volatility with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks: A Comparative Study of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches." 

There will be more information in here once we receive professor feedback. We had to change the direction from sentiment analysis to price volatility due to loosing our sentiment data.
