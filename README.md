# Predictive Ability of Sentiment using Neural Networks on Cryptocurrency Prices
This repository includes all resources regarding my partner and I's research, "Predictive Ability of Sentiment using Neural Networks on Cryptocurrency Prices" (working title). This paper was inspired by reading this paper (https://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/029_report.pdf). In this paper the authors performed sentiment analysis on tweets to gain an edge in the crypto market which we thought was interesting. However, the authors mentioned that future research could expand on error analysis in order to better classify tweets. Come 2022, OpenAI gives open access to its sentiment analysis API, GPT-3, which is superior to prior language models. This begs the question, can GPT-3 improve our ability to analyize text? If so, can our model outperform previous sentiment analysis trading models? 

Currently deciding which learning machine learning models to use for predicting price. 

The final draft of this research will be submitted late April or early May 2023. However, there will be an update in the summer of 2023 to expand the tweet sample to 3 months worth of tweets and will use the GPT-4 model once it is released.
