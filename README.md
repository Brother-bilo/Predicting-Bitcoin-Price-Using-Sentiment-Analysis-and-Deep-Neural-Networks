# Predictive Ability of Sentiment and Various Features on Cryptocurrency Prices
This repository includes all resources regarding my research, "Predictive Ability of Sentiment and Various Features on Cryptocurrency Prices" (working title). This paper reviews the ability to predict Bitcoin price using sentiment analysis of tweets and other features such as block size, cost per TX, hash rate, etc.

I plan on taking a deep dive into error analysis to improve text classification that will likely increase predictive power of the sentiment bot. Also plan on cleaning up the code as I get better at python over the summer.

Update 5/3/2022: The sentiment part will have to wait as my AWS server collects data daily, because my academic permissions for doing a full search with the Twitter API got denied. This server will collect data for about 3-6 months in order for my estimators to be as efficient as possible.
