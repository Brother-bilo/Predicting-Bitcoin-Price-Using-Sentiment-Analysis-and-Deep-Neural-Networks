# Predicting Bitcoin Prices Using Sentiment Analysis and Deep Neural Networks: An Investigation into the Relationship between Social Media Sentiment and Cryptocurrency Market Performance
This repository includes all resources regarding my partner and I's research, "Predicting Bitcoin Prices Using Sentiment Analysis and Deep Neural Networks" (working title). This paper was inspired by reading this paper (https://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/029_report.pdf). In this paper the authors performed sentiment analysis on tweets to gain an edge in the crypto market which we thought was interesting. However, the authors mentioned that future research could expand on error analysis in order to better classify tweets. 

Additionally, we will conduct comparative analysis between deep learning techniques and the conventional autoregressive models, with the aim of discerning the most efficacious method.

3/22/23: Our goal was to use ChatGPT to determine sentiment. The OpenAi api is more expensive than I thought it was lol. However, we will use VADER sentiment analysis instead and compare those sentiment scores to ChatGPT for 4,000 tweets to determine how good VADER really is.

The final draft of this research will be submitted late April or early May 2023. However, there will be an update in the summer of 2023 to expand the tweet sample to 3 months worth of tweets.
