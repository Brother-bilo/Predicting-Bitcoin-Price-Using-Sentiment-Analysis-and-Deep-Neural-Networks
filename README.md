# Predicting Bitcoin Price with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks: A Comparative Study of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches
This repository includes all resources regarding my partner and I's research, "Predicting Bitcoin Price with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks: A Comparative Study of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches." 

Abstract â€“ Forecasting time series data is a topic of ongoing interest in finance and economics. Traditional forecasting methods such as Autoregressive Models (AR), Moving Average Models (MA), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models (ARIMA) have long been used for this purpose. Advances in technology have introduced deep learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network adept at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. This study evaluates whether LSTM networks outperform traditional methods like ARIMA for forecasting Bitcoin prices. Results indicate that ARIMA models outperform LSTM models when applied to Bitcoin prices. The forecasting errors obtained from ARIMA were approximately 2.4% lower than the forecasting errors associated with LSTM, giving reason to believe that LSTM is not as superior as previously thought for forecasting financial time series.
