# Predictive Ability of Sentiment and Various Features on Cryptocurrency Prices
This repository includes all resources regarding my research, "Predictive Ability of Sentiment and Various Features on Cryptocurrency Prices" (working title). This paper reviews the ability to predict Bitcoin price using sentiment analysis of tweets and other features such as block size, cost per TX, hash rate, etc.

I plan on taking a deep dive into error analysis to improve text classification that will likely increase predictive power of the sentiment bot. Also plan on cleaning up the code as I get better at python over time.

Update 1/20/2023: This project has been on the backburner until now, because I did not have the proper access to the Twitter data due to my account restrictions. However, my restrictions have been lifted and the project will resume with my partner Stefan, under the guidance from our professor.
