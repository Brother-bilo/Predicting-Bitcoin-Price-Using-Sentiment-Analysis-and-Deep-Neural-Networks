I spent about 15min to decide when to run the Twitter scrape and decided the scrape should run from 9am to 5pm. 
There is evidence that shows that the crypto markets are most active between 9am and 4pm which coincide with the New York Stock Exchange. I decided to let the scrape run 
until 5pm to catch asset exchanges following the NYSE close at 4pm.
